Welcome to my CSS practice repository. here you will find practiced sets from start.
The images p1 to p6 contain the practice questions which are solved with respective practices with numbers.
The last files are practice6 and loader, loader is last practice set, set 8. 'p8' contained the assignment of creating a loader. I haven't added it. 
Thanks
